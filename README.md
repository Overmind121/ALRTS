# ALRTS
This is a python app that uses the kivy framework. The idea of this app is to alert the user when a certain stock has changed in price, MACD, and RSI value. This repo does not work on the mobile phone as the app keeps crashing when you deploy it. It works on a computer at least. Im planning to use flutter to see if I can yield better results.
